# Milestone 1: Project Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Course:** Data Mining (MO-IT128)  
**Project:** FinMark Customer Segmentation  
**Student:** Trisha Atienza  

## 📌 Objective
This milestone focuses on preparing, validating, and exploring FinMark customer datasets to understand data structure, patterns, and behavioral trends. The outputs of this milestone will serve as inputs for customer segmentation using clustering techniques in subsequent milestones.

## 🔍 Key Activities
- Data verification and consistency checks
- Handling missing values and validating engineered features
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries and visualizations
- Identification of key patterns and features for clustering

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Notes
All datasets are organized to clearly distinguish between raw inputs and processed outputs, ensuring reproducibility and alignment with best practices in data analytics.
