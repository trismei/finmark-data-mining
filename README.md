# FinMark Customer Segmentation (Data Mining Project)

This repository contains the end-to-end data mining workflow for FinMark Corporation’s customer segmentation project using clustering techniques.

## Business Problem
FinMark currently offers standard financial products (e.g., savings, credit, loans) with limited personalization. This project builds a clustering-based customer segmentation model to support personalised product recommendations that improve customer satisfaction and service relevance.

## Project Outputs
- **Milestone 1:** Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Milestone 2:** Clustering & Customer Segmentation Report (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- **Terminal Assessment:** Final Report + Presentation + Product Recommendations

## Repository Structure
- `data/raw/` – raw datasets (not committed)
- `data/processed/` – cleaned/engineered datasets (optional)
- `notebooks/` – development notebooks (preprocessing, EDA, clustering)
- `src/` – reusable python modules (preprocessing, features, clustering, evaluation)
- `reports/` – exported PDFs and figures
- `docs/` – data dictionary, preprocessing notes, methodology

## How to Run
1. Create environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
